void multipleSelection() {
// 1. Check below. This is all plain text, we would like add all resources to an array.
//    Delete the first line and the blank line so only the actual resources remain.
// 2. Place the cursor right after the first *. Press and hold Alt+Shift and use the mouse to select
//    the locations where a cursor is desired, right after every *.
// 3. Release Alt+Shift and start typing. Text should now appear at every cursor. Use backspace to remove
//    all *. Add ' at the start of each line. Move the cursors to the end of the line and add ',
// 4. Hit Escape to revert back to one cursor. Select the | in the first line. Use Select Next Occurrence
//    to select all | characters and have a cursor there. Remove the character and replace it with ', '
//    Move the cursors to the end of the line and press the delete key. This will move all resources to just one line.
// 5. Hit Escape to revert back to one cursor and add array @[ at the beginning of the line and ]; at the end. We now have an array.
// 6. Hold Alt and Shift and drag the mouse from the number 6 in front to the // 1.. Note that the multiple selection now selected
//    a block of text we can work with.
