Create a file template.

These are applied when creating a new file or generating code. Can contain includes. Customize code generation.

1. Open the IDE settings and navigate to IDE Settings | File and Code Templates
2. Under includes, edit the C File Header include so that it matches your preference. Save the changes.
3. Create a new file: Command+N and generate a new C class in the current folder.
   The header for this file should reflect the changes we just made.
4. Create a new file template for an XCTest test:

#parse("C File Header.h")

\#include <XCTest/XCTest.h>

@implementation ${Name} : XCTest
-(void)testSomething {
}
@end

5. Test the new file template. Note that the variables defined in the template can be provided through the New File dialog.
