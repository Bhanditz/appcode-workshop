# AppCode Workshop

In these materials, you'll learn about many of the features and productivity tools available in [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/appcode) IDE. Examples are navigation, editing, inspections, live templates, refactorings, tools like CocoaPods and the REST client and many more things. It's virtually impossible to cover every option and feature in AppCode, but we're providing a number of practical exercises on how we can do our daily work as an OS X or iOS developer.

We'll also cover a vast amount of keyboard shortcuts to make working with AppCode more efficient. Other IntelliJ-based IDE's use the same keyboard shortcuts, so if you know how to work with AppCode, you'll know how to work with IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PhpStorm, RubyMine, PyCharm and more. The keymap is included in the workshop download.

This workshop is self-paced, meaning you can work your way through the exercises on your own, whenever and wherever you want. Exercises come as an AppCode project in which every file is a new exercise that may contain code and tips to get things done.

## Getting the project
There are a couple of ways to get started with the AppCode workshop materials:

* Clone the project using GitHub

    ``git clone https://github.com/JetBrains/appcode-workshop.git``

* Download the ZIP

    ``wget https://github.com/JetBrains/appcode-workshop/archive/master.zip``

## Getting started
There are some things to know about the project:

* To get a short overview of the IDE you can read [Quick Start Guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/appcode/quickstart/) first.
* The project can be opened as-is in AppCode.
* All numbered folders contain exercises that you can work on. Simply open the numbered files one by one and follow the comments in the file. Most exercises are self-contained, others build on previous exercises.
* The AppCode Reference Card.pdf is the AppCode keymap. The latest version can always be found on the [AppCode website](https://www.jetbrains.com/appcode/documentation/).
